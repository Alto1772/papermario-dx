# Paper Mario Deluxe

[![Discord Channel][discord-badge]][discord]

This is a fork of the [Paper Mario decompilation](papermario-repo) which aims to provide a strong foundation for mods/romhacks.

To get started, see [INSTALL](INSTALL.md).

Changes:

- US release only (no JP, PAL, or iQue - none of these are near 100% yet)
- Shiftable builds by default
