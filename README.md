[![Discord Channel][discord-badge]][discord]

This is a fork of the [Paper Mario decompilation](papermario-repo) which aims to provide a strong foundation for mods/romhacks.

To get started, see [INSTALL](INSTALL.md).

Configuration is located in [src/dx/config.h](src/dx/config.h).

Changes:

- US release only (no JP, PAL, or iQue - none of these are near 100% yet)
- Shiftable builds by default
- `DX_DEBUG_MENU` - Enables a debug menu. Toggle with the L button and navigate with the D-pad.
